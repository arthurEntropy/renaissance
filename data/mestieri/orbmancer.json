You have a ball. You charge it up by dribbling it. The real hook is that you get to break the rules of how much you can do on a turn. You link actions together and you get to keep going until something stops you or you “score a basket” - i.e. hit a target or whatever.</p></li><li><p>Here’s the Mestiere from 0.1. It’s probably to literal and silly, but I like the mechanics here:</p><ul><li><p>ORBCRAFT (trait): You may wrap a small magical object in leather, cloth or other flexible material to craft an orb approximately one foot in diameter (scaled larger or smaller depending on your race). Crafting and attuning to the orb takes one hour. While you are wielding the orb, you have access to any native abilities of the object inside it. Describe your orb.</p></li><li><p>BALLER (trait): When you use an Orbmancer move, your damage is 1d4+DEX and your range is 20 ft. Your max MP for Orbmancer is 5.</p></li><li><p>DRIBBLE: When you bounce your orb to charge it with energy, roll+DEX: On a 10+, hold 3, and you may use another Orbmancer Move other than Dribble. On a 7-9, same as 10+, but hold 1. Either way, this hold can be spent on any Orbmancer Move and persists within the orb so long as you or an ally are in possession of it.</p></li><li><p>SHOOT: When you throw your orb at a target, roll+DEX: On a 10+, nothing but net - deal your damage and the orb returns to you. On a 7–9, choose one (whichever you choose, you deal your damage): You have to move to get the shot, placing you in danger as described by the DM. You have to take what you can get: -1d4 damage. You hit, but your orb does not return to you. You must use a Move to retrieve it. Either way, you may spend hold, 1-for-1, to add 1d4 to your damage.</p></li><li><p>JUKE: When you body fake to confuse a foe, roll+DEX: On a 10+, you may move past or away from the foe unimpeded, you may use another Orbmancer Move and you have advantage on the roll. On a 7-9, same as 10+, but no advantage.</p></li><li><p>HEESON’S FIRE (trait): If you hit a target with your orb three Moves in a row, the orb erupts in magical flame, which persists until you take damage. The flame does no harm to you or your allies, but doubles damage dealt with the orb.</p></li><li><p>REACH (trait): Your range increases to 30 ft.</p></li><li><p>FREE THROW (trait): Whenever you take damage from a creature equal to at least half your current HP (round down), you may immediately throw your orb at the creature (if it’s within range). Roll+DEX: On a 7+, you deal half your damage. You may not spend hold to add additional damage.</p></li><li><p>BANK SHOT (improvement - SHOOT): You may bounce your orb off a surface or object as part of its trajectory. The total distance covered must still be within your range.</p></li><li><p>FROM DOWNTOWN (improvement - SHOOT): You may choose to roll with disadvantage to double your range for this Move. If you do so and deal damage to a target beyond your usual range, the damage is tripled.</p></li><li><p>BOOMSHAKALAKA (trait): Your damage increases to 2d4+DEX.</p></li><li><p>PASS THE ROCK: When you throw your orb to an ally, spend 1 MP and both of you roll+DEX and add the results together: On an 18+, the ally catches the orb and has access to your Orbmancer Moves for their next Move. On a 10-17, the ally just catches it. Either way, they may use any hold stored in the orb for their next Move, regardless of Mestiere. To pass the orb back to you, the ally must use a Move to roll+DEX: on a 7+, the orb returns to you.</p></li><li><p>FINGER SPIN: When you spin the orb on your finger, roll+DEX: On a 10+, hold 3, and you may use another Orbmancer Move, including this one. On a 7-9, same a 10+, but hold 1.</p></li><li><p>TRAVELING: When you use your orb to teleport, spend 1 MP and roll+DEX: On a 10+, you disappear and reappear in a spot within your range and you may use another Orbmancer Move other than this one. On a 7-9, same as 10+, but you cannot use another Orbmancer Move.</p></li><li><p>DUNK: When you do a sweet dunk, slamming your orb directly into your opponent from above as a melee attack, spend 1 MP and roll+DEX: On a 10+, you deal your damage, ignoring AC. On a 7-9, you deal half damage, ignoring AC.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Ok, re-reading these for the first time in ages, these are funny, but there’s also some really good mechanics happening here. I really like that you can store energy in the thing. I think we could do more with that. Like, you can dribble for ages and then discharge a ton of damage when it hits. But maybe you have to save one unit of energy to make the orb come back to you.</p></li><li><p>It’s also very cool that you can make your own orbs. Probably need to flesh out how the central item can influence the nature of the orb’s magic.</p></li></ul>"
