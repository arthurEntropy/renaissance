Novizio starts with a small deck of literal, physical cards that the player holds and uses. Advancements add additional cards to the deck. Maybe map advancements to standard playing cards so it’s easy to do.</p></li><li><p>But it’s not a poker or magician thing, it’s more of a tarot thing. Specifically, you draw a card and “interpret” it, by choosing from two or more effects on the card. Like the Intrigue expansion of Dominion (Steward, Pawn, Nobles, etc. - “Choose one…”).</p></li><li><p>Cards should have art and cool names, like “Queen of Knives,” etc.</p></li><li><p>Maybe you can also activate/ignite and throw a card for a one-time big effect, but then you lose the card permanently?</p></li><li><p>Might be interesting if you can buy advancements (cards) multiple times to gain multiple copies of a given card to your deck.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>SECOND PASS:</p><ul><li><p>Use deck of Briscola cards (4 suits of 10 cards - 40 cards total).</p></li><li><p>For each turn, you turn over 3 cards.</p></li><li><p>Based on the cards you turn, you determine the effects of your magic, filling three parts of a spell.</p></li><li><p>I don’t know what the three parts are, but something like target, effect and scale. Or something like that.</p></li><li><p>In cartomancy, there is typically either a 1 or 3 card pull. In the latter, the 3 cards represent past, present and future.</p></li><li><p>2 thru 7 of each suit just have one option per&nbsp; part and you choose which to use from each one. So it could be effect from the first card, scale from the second card, target from the third card.</p></li><li><p>Face cards should offer some sort of meta effect, like drawing additional cards or choosing additional elements for the spell.</p></li><li><p>Aces could be a whole spell in and of themselves and/or augment the whole spell.</p></li><li><p>Each suit doesn’t have intrinsic sets of options. The suits are each assigned to a set of options associated with one of the classical planets: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mara, Jupiter, Saturn.</p></li><li><p>Access to these planets is gained through advancement, and you set which planet is assigned to which suit at the beginning of each day.</p></li><li><p>Each planet should have a theme: fire shit for the Sun? Mysterious shit for Saturn?</p></li><li><p>As a result, you end up with lots of unexpected combinations with multiple planets’ options in single spells.</p></li><li><p>A question is whether the spells should be mostly or even strictly divination.</p></li><li><p>A further layer could be added by having effects based on what zodiac sign the planets are in. Like, for example, if a planet is in Aquarius, you get to pull an additional card for each card of that suit you pull. Adds a layer of interest to what planet you choose for the day, based on where it is.</p></li><li><p>Could base those positions on astrological charts from the Renaissance period. Maybe you get to pick or randomly pick a date within a range that’s the starting point.</p></li><li><p>You shuffle the deck at the start of the day. When you pull a card, it doesn’t go back into the deck until the next day (maybe some cards let you shuffle cards back into the deck as a bonus effect).</p></li><li><p>When you run out of cards to pull for that day, you’re out of magic. So maybe when you’re starting out, you only have access to one or two planets, and thus only have one or two suits in the deck, and thus only have a limited number of pulls for the day. Similar to spell slots.</p></li><li><p>Cross referencing between the actual cards and the effect options will probably be cumbersome. Make it cool by having charts for each planet, and you place a glass stone on what you pull. Maybe there’s a place to put the planet’s current zodiac position, too.</p></li></ul><p>• ⁃ Various cultures could have various graphical styles for cards.</p>",
