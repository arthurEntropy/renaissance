  "description": "<p>For the <em>Uomo d’Armi</em>, battle is not just blood and steel—it’s discipline, timing, and trust. These professional soldiers bring cohesion to chaos, using their training not to dominate the battlefield alone, but to strengthen the whole. With training that guides them in critical moments—when wounds deepen, when allies falter, when escape demands a sacrifice—they are defined by action in adversity. This class rewards players who value group tactics, endurance under fire, and selfless decision-making. A true Uomo d’Armi doesn’t seek fame—they seek the right death, at the right time, for the right reason.</p>",
