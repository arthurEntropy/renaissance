  "description": "<p>The <em>Murato</em> is a walking bulwark, clad in steel and wielding fearsome weapons. Where others conserve energy, they expend itâ€”trading their Endurance for devastating blows. They, endure longer by embracing the burden of their arms, and find power in stillness as much as motion. Through brutal efficiency, a Murato transforms fatigue into ferocity, and armor into an extension of their own flesh.</p><p>Play a Murato if you want to wield huge weapons, take big hits in stride and smash your enemies.</p>",
