  "description": "Born of some ancient, improbable union lost to living knowledge, the Dragonborn bear the strength of dragons with the mere frame of a humanoid form. Some cultivate these unusual gifts and wield them with pride. Others see them as a burden to be overcome. All stand out in a crowd - typically tall and imposing, with scales and horns of many colors.",
