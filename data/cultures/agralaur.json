  "description": "Former Dwarven settlement that sunk into the swamps surrounding the mouth of the river Troutbeck. A new wave of settlers has been building on top of the sunken ruins. The city is in a near-constant state of celebration, with cacasa flowing and sushi rolling.\n\nRowed boats take cargo east and west along the coast, which shipwrights ply their trade at the docks.\n\nNearby, the Dwarven colony of Fim do Trabaljo is home to some of the original settlers, who have taken up a lackadaisical lifestyle on an island of their own making.\n\nDeep within the sunken ruins, half-flooded chambers seem to breathe evil through the cobblestones, tempting adventurers below."
