  "description": "<p><em>Your time among the grain brokers of Ockham has taught you how to spot a great opportunity to make a profit.</em></p><p>On an Intermezzo, you may attempt to broker a trade deal. Spend any amount of treasure you choose to purchase goods. You may also take on debt up to the amount of treasure you spend <em>(so if you put 4 treasure down, you can take on an additional 4 treasure of debt to purchase 8 treasure's-worth of goods)</em>. If you take on debt, establish who you borrow from.</p><p><strong>Describe the goods, how you purchase them and how you intend to sell them for a profit.</strong></p><p>Roll Awe, Perform or Persuade to determine the outcome. The TN is 10 plus the value of the goods. On a success, you manage to sell the goods for twice what you paid for them. On a failure, the goods are damaged, lost or stolen, and your investment is lost (you still owe your debt). Success with consequence is up to DM discretion, as usual.</p>",
