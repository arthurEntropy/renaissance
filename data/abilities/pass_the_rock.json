  "description": "<p>You throw your orb to an ally. Both of you roll Dexterity, adding the results together:</p><p>On a 10+ the ally just catches the orb and may use any charges stored in the orb as if they were MP, regardless of their Mestiere. On a 20+, they also have access to your Orbmancer abilities while holding the orb. At the beginning of your next turn, the orb magically returns to you.</p><p>On a 9 or less, the orb lands in a space adjacent to the ally (GM's choice) and there is no further effect and you must retrieve the orb as normal.</p>",
