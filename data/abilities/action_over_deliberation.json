  "description": "<p>When the party debates how to approach a dangerous situation, your patience wears thin. For each proposed course of action beyond the first—so long as it’s suggested by someone other than you—roll 1d6 and add it to a running total. If the total exceeds 10, choose one:</p><ul><li><p>Charge ahead recklessly, ignoring your companions’ concerns.</p></li><li><p>Break something, make a loud noise, or otherwise draw unwanted attention (or reveal sensitive information).</p></li><li><p>Check two conditions.</p></li></ul><p>If the party agrees on a plan before you cross the threshold, halve the total of your count (rounded down) and gain that many +1d to use while carrying out the agreed-upon plan.</p><p><strong>Describe how your temper simmers and/or boils over.</strong></p>",
