  "name": "Action Over Deliberation",
  "description": "When the party debates how to approach a dangerous situation, your patience wears thin. For each proposed course of action beyond the first—so long as it’s suggested by someone other than you—roll 1d6 and add it to a running total. If the total exceeds 10, choose one:\n\n- Charge ahead recklessly, ignoring your companions’ concerns.\n\n- Break something, make a loud noise, or otherwise draw unwanted attention (or reveal sensitive information).\n\n- Check two conditions.\n\nIf the party agrees on a plan before you cross the threshold, halve the total (rounded down) and gain that many +1d to use while carrying out the agreed-upon plan.\n\nDescribe how your temper simmers and/or boils over.",
