If you or an ally knocks another foe unconscious before the end of your next turn, the bonus increases to +2d. This bonus continues from round to round, but ends if, at the end of your turn, neither you nor an ally has knocked a foe unconscious in the last round.</p><p><strong>Describe how each victory pushes your group to fight with greater fury.</strong></p>",
