Choosing to share your this name with another is an act of great significance and trust, for those who possess it wield power over you, but can also be of great help to you. Someone who knows your true name always rolls favored when acting upon you, whether their intent is good or evil.\n\nConversely, the more names you can accumulate for yourself, the more powerful you become.\n\nAlso, you can't sleep in beds.\n\n",
