  "description": "You have a long, sticky tongue that can extend to a length up to your speed and can be retracted at-will. Unsecured objects and creatures that weigh less than half your body weight automatically stick to the tongue and are dragged with it when retracted. Heavier objects require a Strengh check to pull and heavier creatures oppose with their own Strength check.",
