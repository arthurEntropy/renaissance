  "description": "In combat, whenever a creature within short range takes damage from a source other than you, you gain +1d. On your turn, you may spend any number of these bonus dice on your skill checks.\n\nUnused dice are lost at the end of your turnâ€”unless you hit and deal damage. If you do, you may pass any remaining +1d to any number of creatures within short range. Recipients must use the bonus dice on their next turn or lose them.\n\nDescribe how you turn the chaos of battle to your advantage.",
