  "description": "In your time among the paper-lanterned streets and bohemian shops of Chobham, you've seen how fortune telling - real and fake - can sway people's actions. Choose a technique like palm reading, astrology or reading tea leaves.\n\nOnce per long rest, you can read someone's fortune, granting them +1d to their next check made that day with a relevant skill (GM discretion). Describe your technique. Do you believe that you're actually telling the future or is it an effective placebo?",
